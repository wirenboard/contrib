mosquitto (1.6.6-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * SECURITY UPDATE: If an MQTT v5 client connects to Mosquitto, sets a last
    will and testament, sets a will delay interval, sets a session expiry
    interval, and the will delay interval is set longer than the session
    expiry interval, then a use after free error occurs, which has the
    potential to cause a crash in some situations.
    - CVE awaiting assignment
  * SECURITY UPDATE: If a malicious MQTT client sends a SUBSCRIBE packet
    containing a topic that consists of approximately 65400 or more '/'
    characters, i.e. the topic hierarchy separator, then a stack overflow will
    occur.
    - CVE awaiting assignment

  * New upstream release.
  * Remove fix-step3.patch, fixed upstream.

 -- Roger A. Light <roger@atchoo.org>  Mon, 18 Feb 2019 09:28:40 +0000

mosquitto (1.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY UPDATE: If Mosquitto is configured to use a password file for
    authentication, any malformed data in the password file will be treated as
    valid. This typically means that the malformed data becomes a username and
    no password. If this occurs, clients can circumvent authentication and get
    access to the broker by using the malformed username. In particular, a blank
    line will be treated as a valid empty username. Other security measures are
    unaffected. Users who have only used the mosquitto_passwd utility to create
    and modify their password files are unaffected by this vulnerability.
    - debian/patches/mosquitto-1.4.x-cve-2018-12551.patch: this fix introduces
      more stringent parsing tests on the password file data.
    - CVE-2018-12551
  * SECURITY UPDATE: If an ACL file is empty, or has only blank lines or
    comments, then mosquitto treats the ACL file as not being defined, which
    means that no topic access is denied. Although denying access to all
    topics is not a useful configuration, this behaviour is unexpected and
    could lead to access being incorrectly granted in some circumstances.
    - debian/patches/mosquitto-1.4.x-cve-2018-12550.patch: this fix ensures
      that if an ACL file is defined but no rules are defined, then access will
      be denied.
    - CVE-2018-12550
  * SECURITY UPDATE: If a client publishes a retained message to a topic that
    they have access to, and then their access to that topic is revoked, the
    retained message will still be delivered to future subscribers. This
    behaviour may be undesirable in some applications, so a configuration
    option `check_retain_source` has been introduced to enforce checking of
    the retained message source on publish.
    - debian/patches/mosquitto-1.4.8-cve-2018-12546.patch: this patch stores
      the originator of the retained message, so security checking can be
      carried out before re-publishing. The complexity of the patch is due to
      the need to save this information across broker restarts.
    - CVE-2018-12546
  * New upstream release.
  * Bump standards version to 4.3.0, no changes needed.
  * fix-step3.patch: fix compilation error.

    - CVE-2017-7652

    This has the potential to lead to an OOM situation and the broker being
    killed by the system.
    - debian/patches/mosquitto-1.4.10_cve-2017-7652.patch: Limit the maximum
      size of CONNECT packet to a reasonable value, and add "memory_limit"
      option to set the maximum memory the broker will use.
